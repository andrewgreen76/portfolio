I understand your question now. In the BMP file format, the "data offset" field is a 32-bit (4-byte) integer that specifies the offset in bytes from the beginning of the file to the start of the pixel data. It is typically located at bytes 10 to 13 (bytes 6-9 are reserved) in the BMP header structure.

In your case, you mentioned that the "data offset" in your BMP file is 0x8A (138 in decimal), which means that the pixel data starts at byte offset 0x8A from the beginning of the file. This value is different from the standard BMP format, where the "data offset" is usually set to 0x36 (54 in decimal).

The reason for this difference could be due to variations or customizations in the BMP file format. Different BMP files may have different header structures and data offsets based on their specific requirements or origin.

When working with BMP files, it's important to follow the format specified by the particular BMP file you are dealing with. In your case, you should use the custom data offset value (0x8A) to correctly locate and read the pixel data in your BMP file, as I mentioned in the previous response.

To summarize, the "data offset" field in a BMP header specifies the byte offset from the beginning of the file to the start of the pixel data, and its value can vary in different BMP files based on their format or customization.
