Ben Eater's VGA "card" is designed to display images with the resolution of 100x75 and a 64-color range.
Though something like this can be improved on, I feel like going further with this project would prove to be
a waste of time as the VGA technology nowadays is pretty much obsolete. I did this for fun, because I wanted
to learn some kind of video graphics technology, and because committing to learning how HDMI works promises
to be a daunting task.
